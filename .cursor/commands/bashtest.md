# Bash test

## GOAL INSTRUCTIONS

I want to decorate bash script invoking series of commands to a test case that will capture error code of each execution, to create a summary list at the end with name of the command (test name) and result.

Note that invocations may be failing intentionally to manifest expected errors. It should be handled as negative test.

## CODE HINTS

Keep code in external test_helper.sh file in ./bin directory. Source this file in actual test batch.

## DO NOT LIST

Do not change order of tests.
Do not add any new tests.
