# Update README

Update README with:
1. list of bash tests in repository root.
2. list of collections without too much details
3. configuration files without too much details

## Scope

Use app1 and node1 assets only. Look for existing state machine. Generally use states and assets that are used in test_*.sh files.

## Do not list

do not add dependency install as we have no dependencies
